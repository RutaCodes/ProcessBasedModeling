Here include all the work that I did when I edited HYMOD model from its initial form that was used before and how I edited show routine to improve model accuracy. 
Since I was studying watersheds that were snow dominated, I needed a model that had a robust snow routine. Initial HYMOD version did not provide that, so I needed to
develop a new routine based on process based equations.
