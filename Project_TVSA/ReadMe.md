# Plain Language Summary

Computer models are useful tools that can be used to analyze what inputs matter most to ensuring that model output is similar to observed conditions. In order to understand how very wet years versus very dry years impact which model inputs (called parameters) are most important to matching good predictions, we simulated streamflow using a simple mathematical model many thousands of times. We used these outputs to determine how variations in predictions of streamflow (output from the model) are related to variations in model parameters, to identify which parameters are most important for ensuring reasonable model predictions. We focused on watersheds that are close together, but that may experience different average conditions and interannual variability. We found that which parameters are important varied across different watersheds and also varied with total annual precipitation and watershed elevation. In addition, we found that drought impacted the importance of processes in the model, especially in mountainous watersheds. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding how watersheds respond to varying annual conditions, as this type of knowledge is essential to anticipate the future of streamflow availability and inform the management style that needs to be implemented to predict water availability in these systems.
