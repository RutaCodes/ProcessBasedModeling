Hydrologic Modeling (ERE 645) is a graduate level course that was being taught by Prof. Chuck Kroll in the Department of Environmental Resources Engineering at SUNY ESF. It is designed to teach students about deterministic and stochastic hydrologic models, model development, and the use of computer programming to construct, calibrate, manipulate, and interpret hydrologic models. Theoretical and analytical approaches to describe hydrologic processes, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, infiltration, surface runoff, percolation, and groundwater discharge. Stochastic techniques like frequency, trend, and regression analyses were used.

Course Software:
In this course, the software package R was used. R is a language and environment that can be used for statistical computing and graphics. Multiple computing packages within the R environment that are focused on statistical and process-based analyses were used. Excel was also used for data pre- processing, and the graphical user interface Studio. The R package is freeware, and can be downlonded for multiple computing platforms at https://www.r-project.org/. RStudio is also freeware, and can be obtained at https://www.rstudio.com/.

Course Objectives:
1) To develop and improve computer programming and data manipulation skills 
2) To gain experience in the development and programming of stochastic anddeterministic hydrologic models 
3) To introduce commonly employed rainfall-runoff models and modeling techniques, and to investigate the performance of some of these models
4) To critically evaluate some hydrologic publications, models, and modeling results
5) To provide an introduction to physics based and empirical models for hydrologic phenomenon, such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff mechanisms, infiltration, groundwater discharge, and streamflow
