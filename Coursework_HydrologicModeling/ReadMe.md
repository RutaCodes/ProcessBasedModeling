Hydrologic Modeling (ERE 645) is a graduate level course that was being taught by Prof. Chuck Kroll in the Department of Environmental Resources Engineering at SUNY ESF. It is designed to teach students about deterministic and stochastic hydrologic models, model development, and the use of computer programming in R to construct, calibrate, manipulate, and interpret hydrologic models. Theoretical and analytical approaches to describe hydrologic processes, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, infiltration, surface runoff, percolation, and groundwater discharge. Stochastic techniques like frequency, trend, and regression analyses were used.
