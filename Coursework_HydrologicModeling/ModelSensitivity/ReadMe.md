# Why Use Sensitivity Analysis?

Often we are interested in performing model sensitivity analyses to:
1) Examine how changes in input parameters impacts model output
2) Test model robustness (Re. variations in output) due to uncertainty in inputparameters
3) Reduce the dimensionality of the model by
   a) Identifying model inputs that cause the largest changes in modeloutput and focusing on improved estimation of these parameters(uncertainty reduction)
   b) Setting less sensitive inputs to fixed values (model simplification)
   
Sensitivity Analysis Methods:
1) Local Methods
2) Global Methods
   a) Monte Carlo with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHC-MC)
   b) Morris One-factor-At-a-Time (OAT)
   c) Variance decomposition
