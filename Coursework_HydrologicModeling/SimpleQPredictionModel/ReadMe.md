SimpleQPredictions.R code predicts streamflow using simple Q=P-E model, which assumes that streamflow can be estimated by subtracting estimated evapotranspiration (output) from precipitation (input) while ignoring any other potential outputs in the system. It also calculates variuous statistics to estimate its accuracy.

Q - Daily Streamflow
P - Daily Precipitation
E - Estimated Evapotranspiration

Evaporatraspiration was calculated using Hamon method.
