MAIN CODE - CorrectMissingValues.R

If some values are missing from climate monitoring station of interest (e.g. temperature monitoring station), those values can be corrected using other monitoring stations around the study site. However, distance between those stations and study site needs to be taken into account while substituting missing values from further monitoring stations.
